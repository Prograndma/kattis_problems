Hello there

 years and my life is still
Tryin to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means
PreChorus
And so I cry sometimes when Im lying in bed
Just to get it all out whats in my head
And I I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
Whats going on
Chorus
And I say heyeyey
Heyeyey
I said Hey awhats going on

In this institution
And I pray
Oh my God do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution
I said Hey whats going on
Wake in the morning and step outside
Take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream
Heyey yeah yeah yeah
Outro
For a destination mmm
Cant the future just wait
Cant the deadlines come fashionably late
I could push every goal back
Take control back
If theyd roll back the rate
At which time starts to fly
Never landing or standing by
Never taking a break
Ever making me retry
We nickelanddime every quarter to two
But maybe its time to let time pass through
If the future is bright
It doesnt shine with that end of the tunnel light
More like a deer in the headlights
Sudden red lights
Or youre dead lights
As the anglerfish bite
Its not fair
The past is clear but its clear back there
Whats ahead No one knows
But its closing in we swear
Still not in my prime I have so much to do
I cant just rewrite decisions when life gets strange
Should I go with my gut on which door I should shut
Im unsure
Id keep exploring this rut
But what good is time without change
Move on
Cause things never last
Just move on
Cause it goes too fast and the past has passed
So move on
No one likes an ending
So whats with the attention we keep on giving them
Why are we still spending so much time
Dreading our lives instead of living them
Why do we try to divert the river
When the water is what will deliver us where we need to go
We may never know why
Time is always in limited supply
But well live to regret it
If we get it
And then let it slip by
It can never rewind
Once youve lost it its hard to find
Take the journey in stride
When your plans have been sidelined
Every hourly chime could begin something new
So maybe its time to let time pass through
Not passing by but passing through
Til the well runs dry
Just passing through
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must have had yourself a change of heart like
Halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I cant face
And memories are somethin even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel but theres COVID on the planes
And I love Vermont but its the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom she forgot that I existed
And its half my fault but I just like to play the victim
Ill drink alcohol til my friends come home for Christmas
And Ill dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have but I did not lose
Now youre tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And Im split in half but thatll have to do
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from dad
No I am no longer funny cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me forever now you still cant call me back
Oh thatll have to do
My other half was you
I hope this pains just passin through
But I doubt it
Have to do
You turn my guitar on
And Id give up forever to touch you
Cause I know that you feel me somehow
Youre the closest to heaven that Ill ever be
And I dont want to go home right now
Cause all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
So and sooner or later its over
I just dont wanna miss you tonight
And I dont want the world to see me
Cause I dont think that theyd understand
When everythings made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And you cant fight the tears that aint coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
So when everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know youre alive
I just want you to know who I am hey
I want you guys to take this one home alright
And I just want you to know who I am
Yeah
You guys are the best
This the the best th of July ever
Ever ever ever
Give yourself some love
You have no idea how much we love you goodnight
Thank you for sticking around
Alright yall yeah
We gonna try do one more for you okay
We got one more
I am a question to the world
Not an answer to be heard
Or a moment thats held in your arms
And what do you think youd ever say
I wont listen anyway you dont know me
And Ill never be what you want me to be
And what do you think youd understand
Im a boy no Im a man
You cant take me and throw me away
And how can you learn whats never shown
Yeah you stand here on your own
They dont know me cause Im not here
And I want a moment to be real
Wanna touch things I dont feel
Wanna hold on and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change
Theyre the ones that stay the same
And you see the things they never see
All you wanted I could be
Now you know me and Im not afraid
And I wanna tell you who I am
Can you help me be a man
They cant break me as long as I know who I am
They cant see me but Im still here
They cant tell me who to be
Cause Im not what they see
Yeah the world is still sleepin
While I keep on dreaming for me
And their words are just whispers
And lies that Ill never believe
And how can they say I never change
Im the one now cause Im still here
Im the one cause Im still here
Im still here Im still here Im still here
Candy shes sweet like candy in my veins
Baby Im dying for another taste
And every night my mind is running around her
Thunders getting louder and louder
Baby youre like lightning in a bottle
I cant let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck
By your electric love
Baby your electric love ah
Electric love ahah
Drown me drown me you make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me oh hold me deep beneath your waves
Thunders getting louder and louder and louder
Rushing through me
I feel your energy rushing through me
Baby your electric
Verse 
Old suitcase clean getaway
Im the one who takes the blame again
New day but the same lines
I feel like a victim of the dollar sign
All these years on my own
Fight my fight all alone
Til you came dont you know
Dont you know
Baby youre the highlight of my lowlife ayy Lowlife lowlife
Take a shitty day and make it alright yeah alright
Oh in every circumstance
Yeah you make the difference
Baby youre the highlight of my lowlife lowlife
Lowlife lowlife
This bad taste these headaches
Wake up on the floor again ah yeah
My torn dress this failed test
Soon they will be erased
the grudge
Olivia Rodrigo
lacy
Knockoff
Poppy
And I get so lonely
I cant make it on my own
And I need to call ya
Can you come to my chateau
Take me in your arms and
Hold me tight yeah pull me close
Whisper in my ear
All I want you to say is
Baby youre the highlight of my lowlife ayy
Alone in a crowded room
My eyes will search for you
Abandoned by my company
Ill search for whats in front of me
And hope that I find something new
My heart is like the ocean searching
Searching for the shore Im learning
There must be something more than dreaming
Oohoohoohoohoohoooh oohoohoohoohoohoooh
Oohoohoohoohoohoooh
This heart of mine is tired
But my feet will not retire
The alcohol will not suppress
The fear of death and loneliness
I know that Im not alone
Ive wrestled with the truth for quite some time
And Ive been drowning in this restless mind
Im sick of being so unsatisfied
Tell me that the answers right
God are You awake at night
Cause Ive been abandoned by my company
Baby I dont feel so good six words you never understood
Ill never let you go five words youll never say aww
I laugh along like nothings wrong four days has never felt so long
If threes a crowd and two was us one slipped away hahahahaha
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I cant tell you how much I wish I didnt wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Is there a reason were not through
Is there a step just for you
Our conversations all in blue
 heys Hey hey hey hey
Ten fingers tearin out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at seven you were six minutes away
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Dont say Im not your type
Just say that Im not your preferred sexual orientation
Im so selfish
But you make me feel helpless yeah
And I cant stand another day
Stand another day
But all you do is look the other way hmm
Hey I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
Calling my name and I follow just to find you
I trace the faith to a broken down television and put on the weather
And Ive trained myself to give up on the past cause
I frozen time between hearses and caskets
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
I wanna get better
While my friends were getting high and chasing girls down parkway lines
I was losing my mind because the love the love the love the love the love
That I gave wasted on a nice face
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away
So now Im standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
Hey I wanna get better
I didnt know I was lonely til I saw your face
I wanna get better better better better
I didnt know I was broken til I wanted to change
I go up to my room and theres girls on the ceiling
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Of an eighteen year old who didnt know what loss was
Now Im a stranger
And I miss the days of a life still permanent
Mourn the years before I got carried away
So now Im staring at the interstate screaming at myself
Cause Im sleeping in the back of a taxi
Im screaming from my bedroom window
Even if its gonna kill me
Woke up this morning early before my family
From this dream where she was trying to show me
How a life can move from the darkness
She said to get better
So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
And I crash my car cause I wanna get carried away
Thats why Im standing on the overpass screaming at myself
I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought but I was kind
And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes
Clear your heart
Cut the cord
Are we human
Or are we dancer
My sign is vital
My hands are cold
And Im on my knees
Looking for the answer
Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye
Wish me well
Youve gotta let me go
Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight
There is no message were receiving
Let me know is your heart still beating
Youve gotta let me know
Do I look lonely
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me I dont look the same
Maybe I lost weight
Im playing hooky with the best of the best
Put my heart on my chest so that you can see it too
Im walking the long road watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tingles my neck how do I live
The death of a bachelor
Oh oh
Letting the water fall
Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after woo
How could I ask for more
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor
Im cutting my mind off
Feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two and I just wanna be served
And when you think of me am I the best youve ever had
Share one more drink with me smile even though youre sad
Far away
This ship is taking me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die
Starlight
I will be chasing a starlight
Until the end of my life
I dont know if its worth it anymore
Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold
You in my arms
My life
You electrify my life
Lets conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive
Ill never let you go
If you promise not to fade away
Never fade away
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Black holes and revelations yeah
Where is your boy tonight
I hope he is a gentleman
And maybe he wont find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
When I wake up
Im willing to take my chances on
The hope I forget that you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you for you so
You need him I could be him
I could be an accident but Im still tryin
And thats more than I can say for him
Someday Ill appreciate in value
Get off my ass and call you
The mean time Ill sport my brand new fashion
Of waking up with pants on at four in the afternoon
One two three four
Wont find out
He wont find out
Maybe he wont find out what I know
In the morning when you wake up
I like to believe you are thinking of me
And when the sun comes through your window
I like to believe youve been dreaming of me
Dreaming
I know
Cause Id spend half this morning
Thinking about the tshirt you sleep in
I should know
Cause Id spend all the whole day
Listening to your message Im keeping
And never deleting
When I saw you
Everyone knew
I liked the effect that you had on my eyes
But no one else heard
The weight of your words
Or felt the effect that they have on my mind
Falling
Im still alive but Im barely breathin
Just prayed to a God that I dont believe in
Cause I got time while she got freedom
Cause when a heart breaks no it dont break even
Her best days will be some of my worst
She finally met a man thats gonna put her first
While Im wide awake shes no trouble sleepin
Cause when a heart breaks no it dont break even even no
What am I supposed to do when the best part of me was always you And
What am I supposed to say when Im all choked up that youre okay
Im fallin to pieces yeah
Im fallin to pieces
They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gonna stop the bleedin
Cause shes moved on while Im still grievin
And when a heart breaks no it dont break even even no
And what am I going to do when the best part of me was always you And
One still in love while the other ones leavin
Oh you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
You took your suitcase I took the blame
Now Im tryna make sense of what little remains oh
Cause you left me with no love and no love to my name
Cause when a heart breaks no it dont break
No it dont break no it dont break even no
What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you And
Oh that youre okay now
Im fallin to pieces oh Im fallin fallin yeah
Oh it dont break even no
These words are supposed to be simple
But it seems thats not the case
This page is staring back at me
Im afraid to put a mark on its face
Oh Im just tryna introduce you
To this idea that Ive grown used to
Its like sharing a dream with someone
Once you say it out loud it cant be undone
Id jump off and into your arms
But I cant trust the fall
Take my voice Im giving it though
I dont feel safe at all
I cant trust the fall
Its like waking up in surgery
I cant seem to see right past the lights and Im
So scared to take a knife to my chest
Let you see the heart thats inside
Yeah once you say it out loud it cant be undone
But I cant trust the fall I cant trust the fall
I dont feel safe at all dont feel safe at all
She put my name with yellow hearts
Her favorite color like the stars
I didnt listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
I said she was a work of art
I drive down open roads so slow
Here comes the train I let it go
Aint got nobody on my phone
I dont like being all alone
Not good at keeping with the trends
Too good at welcoming amends
Its been a while since I heard her
Say that we were more than friends
Oh I III know a lot is going on
But girl please tell me and Ill let you be
Are you still with me or not
She put yellow hearts around my name
I thought they were all just the same
To you what do they really mean
Have you only been playing games
Im by the garden with the carpenter bees
Like Im Bob Rossin with a Harden beard
Taking it all in like I got no issues in my nature
Primroses blooming in the night
Birds wanna take me on a flight
Appreciating my land before it turns into a glacier
Chasers are of no good use
This taste will be long endured
Whyd you have to go so soon
I thought this was good as new
Please come now I think Im falling
Im holding on to all I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And Im trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But Im down to one last breath
And with it let me say let me say
Hold me now
Im six feet from the edge and Im thinking
Maybe six feet aint so far down
Im looking down now that its over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out Heaven save me save me
Maybe six feet aint so far down Im so far down
Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe theres something left for me
So please come stay with me
Cause I still believe theres something left for you and me
For you and me for you and me
Im six feet from the edge and Im thinking thinking
Mr Hollywood wont you come back soon
She said Mr Hollywood wont you come back soon
She said Mr Hollywood wont you come back soon ayy ayy
She said
Ooh I just wanna lay right by your side
We dont gotta love each other right
We just gotta make it through the night
You dont gotta say
Youre not into me no more
When we pass out on the floor
See the sun rise through the door
By the way you move I know you want me to
Tell you all the rules I know Im searching too
Give me all your clues and things to guide me through
The end of the world the end of the world
Dont blow out the fuse when darkness comes to light
So much I could do to make you come to life
Fingers coming loose I see theres no more time
Dont tell me Im gone dont tell me Im gone
Help me its like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just cant
It isnt in my blood
Laying on the bathroom floor feeling nothing
Im overwhelmed and insecure give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and youll feel better
Just take her home and youll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
Im crawling in my skin
Im looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again I hate this
Im tryna find a way to chill cant breathe oh
Is there somebody who could help me
Its like the walls are caving in
It isnt in my blood oh
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
It isnt in my blood oh oh
Oh oh oh
Hey

Love your imperfections every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
The way that Gucci look on you amazing
But nothing can compare to when youre naked
Now a backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you the one for me I need to face it

Aint nobody else that Id be under
Beautiful beautiful life right now
Beautiful beautiful night right now
No no nooooo
The way that dress fall off you is amazing
Love a miracle a beautiful creation
Baby come a little closer let me taste it
You came a little closer now youre shaking
Never ever gon mislead you

Stop and stare like a sculpture
Painted in your colors
Beautiful beautiful by my side right now yeah
Hey no no
Beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful angel angel
Love your imperfections every angle no no yeah
The way that Gucci look on you amazing hey
But nothing can compare to when youre naked oh oh
Tomorrow comes and go before you know

Swear to God youre beautiful yeah
I dont want a friend just me
I want my life in two my life in two
Just one more night
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you all night
Im done fighting all night waiting for you
When Im around slow dancing in the dark
Dont follow me youll end up in my arms
You have made up your mind
I dont need no more signs
Can you
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him I cant compete
You looked at me like I was someone else oh well
Cant you see Cant you see
I dont wanna slow dance I dont want to slow dance
In the dark
Dark
When you gotta run
Just hear my voice in you my voice in you
Shutting me out of you shutting me out of you
Doing so great so great so great
You
Used to be the one used to be the one
To hold you when you fall
Yeah yeah yeah when you fall when you fall
I dont fuck with your tone I dont fuck with your tone
I dont wanna go home I dont wanna go home
Can it be one night
Cant you see
Swear I couldnt sleep a wink last night
No point in turnin off the lights
Not the same without your head on my shoulders
Growin pains but I dont wanna get older
Almost like we left it all on read
Couple feelings never laid to rest
Didnt know that the party was over
And its true that I need you here closer
Burning photos
Had to learn to let go
I used to be
Somebody in another skin another skin
I heard that youre happy without me
And I hope its true
I hope I hope its true
It kills me a little thats okay
Cause Id die for you
You know Id still die for you
I hope youre getting everything you needed needed
Found the puzzle piece and feel completed completed
Just wanted you to know every reason
Hope you really know that I mean that
I couldnt see
The forest from the trees
Only time we speak
Is in my dreams
Georgia wrap me up in all your
I want you in my arms
Oh let me hold you
Ill never let you go again like I did
Oh I used to say
I would never fall in love again until I found her
I said I would never fall unless its you I fall into
I was lost within the darkness but then I found her
I found you
Georgia pulled me in I asked to
Love her once again
You fell I caught you
As I walk through the streets of my new city
My back feeling much better I suppose
Ive reclaimed the use of my imagination
For better or for worse Ive yet to know
But I always knew youd be the one to understand me
I guess thats why it took so long to get things right
Suddenly Im lost
On my street
On my block
Oh why Oh why
Oh why havent you been there for me
Cant you see Im losing my mind this time
This time I think its for real I can see
All the tree tops turning red
The beggars near bodegas grin at me
I think they want something
I close my eyes I tell myself to breathe
And be calm
Be calm
I know you feel like you are breaking down
Oh I know that it gets so hard sometimes
Im scared that everyone is out to get me
These days before you speak to me you pause
I always see you looking out your window
After all you lost your band you left your mom
Now every single crack every penny that I pass
Says I should either leave or pick it up
But with every single buck Ive made
Im saddled with bad luck that came
The moment I was baptized
Or when I found out one day Im gonna die
If only I could find my people or my place in life
A when they come acarolin
So loud so bright the theremin
Will lead us to a chorus
Where well all rejoice and sing a song that goes
Oh be calm
I know that it gets so hard sometimes
Take it from me Ive been there a thousand times
You hate your pulse because it thinks youre still alive
And everythings wrong
It just gets so hard sometimes
I dont remember much that night
Just walking thinking fondly of you
Thinking how the worst is yet to come
When from that street corner came a song
And I cant remember the man
The panhandler or his melody
The words exchanged had far exceeded any change Id given thee
You hate your pulse because it still thinks youre alive
Ive been waiting for months
Waiting for years
Waiting for you to change
Aw but there aint much thats dumber
There aint much thats dumber
Than pinning your hopes on a change in another
And I yeah I still need you but what goods that gonna do
Needing is one thing and getting getting is another
So I been sitting around
Wasting my time
Wondering what you been doing
Aw and it aint real forgiving
It aint real forgiving
Sitting here picturing someone else living
Ive been hoping for months
Hoping for years
Hoping I might forget
Aw but it dont get much dumber
It dont get much dumber
Than trying to forget a girl when you love her
Oh needing is one thing and getting getting is another
Youre right
Theres nothing more lovely
Theres nothing more profound
Than the certainty
Than the certainty that all of this will end
That all of this will end
So open your arms to me
Open your arms to me
This will be the one moment that matters and
This will be the one thing we remember and
This will be the reason to rebel yeah and
This will be the one moment that matters at all
So while the mile reclaims our footprints
And while our bones keep looking back
The overgrowth is swallowing the path
Therefore the grace of God go we
Therefore the grace of time and chance
And entropys cruel hands
So wont you stay here with me
And well build til we blister our hands
And well build us some temples build us some castles
Build us some monuments and burn them all right down
Oh sugar oh sugar cant you see
How hard Im trying
You know you gotta you know you gotta eventually
Make up your mind
Cause no ones gonna find you
When youre hiding in the dark
No ones gonna find you
So wont you so wont you talk to me
Its time to decide
Cause no ones gonna save you
If you dont swim for the boat
No ones gonna save you
If you wont take the rope
And its end love the sky is falling
End love the sky is falling
The sky is falling
So sugar so sugar dance with me
This one last time
We got no reason we got no reason I can see
To hold back tonight
Cause no ones gonna catch you
If you cant just let go
No ones gonna love you
If you cant let love show
Make up your mind You gotta make up your mind
End love the sky is the sky is falling
It was late at night
You held on tight
From an empty seat
A flash of light
It will take a while
To make you smile
Somewhere in these eyes
Im on your side
You wideeyed girls
You get it right
Fall back into place
Tender is the night
For a broken heart
Who will dry your eyes
When it falls apart
What makes this fragile world go round
Were you ever lost
Was she ever found
Life begins to happen
When I plan somethin else
Tryna be somebody
But all I got was someone else
My plans always changin
Always rearrangin no
Slow it down release control
Slow and steady let me know
The hardest place to be
Is right where you are
In the space between
The finish and the start
Its the arrow in your heart
The arrow in your heart
Now Im restless
Runnin from the present
I I know my minds been cheated
Thinkin that I will arrive
But my plans always changin
Arrow in your heart
Run fast and Ill end up exhausted
Out of breath thinkin where I went wrong
This heart is afraid to beat slowly
Miss a chance at what I could become
I know that I cant run forever
But I cant stand still for too long
The hardest place to be oh
When Im furthest from myself
Feeling closer to the stars
Outer space
Ive been invaded by the dark
Cant escape
Trying to recognize myself when I feel Ive been replaced
But I can feel a kick down in my soul
Ohhohohwoahoh
And its pulling me back to Earth to let me know
I am not a slave cant be contained
So pick me from the dark and pull me from the grave cause
I still feel alive
When it is hopeless I start to notice
That I still feel alive
Falling forward back into orbit
Yeaah
So when I lose my gravity in this sleepy womb
Drifting as I dream but Ill wake up soon
To realize the hand of life is reaching out
To rid me of my pride I call allegiance to myself
Ohoh and I still feel alive
Falling forward back into orbit yeaah
I can feel a kick down in my soul
And this heart that beats inside of me will show
It will show
Floating in outer space have I misplaced a part of my soul
Lost in the inbetween or so it seems Im out of control
Lost in the inbetween but it cant keep me asleep for long cause
I can feel it
When it is hopeless
It aint hopeless
I start to notice
Falling forward
Back into orbit
Start to notice
It aint hopeless cause I start to notice
It was something I believed in
Aint no rest until the bank accounts peakin
They say the city never sleeps in
But living busy isnt giving you your worth
Slowing down is fighting back
The time you take is given back
Shifting gears is saving gas
Hiding in the quiet is well of wisdom
Slowing down and see it
Rest is a secret
I start to believe in
This citys built on blood and muscle
Skyscrapers held up by philosophy of hustling
But Saturday is my cathedral
A day to stop and rest is holding up the steeple
This might be news to all the people
Living busy isnt giving you your worth
Hiding in the quiet is a world of wisdom
Stopping the motion to process the moment
Why dont we stop just to process
Can I take a minute maybe a breath to breathe
Can I take a second Im craving clarity
So lost in the thought of what one day I could be that
That I forgot to take some time to make a richer me
I searched around to find myself a mental cure
I took a break thats probably what I was looking for
What once was lost has finally got me reassured
Leaving room for greater paths
Letting go and kicking back
Reading books and taking baths
Slowing down is
Stopping the motion stopping the motion
Glamorous
Indie rocknroll is what I want

Flipping through a thrift store magazine

Electric girls with worn down toys

A coffee shop with a cause then Ill freak you out
No sex no drugs no rock no roll

And run and run
Tonight
Everything will be alright everything will be alright

Alright alright

I wasnt shopping for a doll
To say the least I thought Id seen them all
But then you took me by surprise
Im dreaming bout those dreamy eyes I never knew I never knew
So take your suitcases I dont mind
And baby doll I meant it every time
You dont need to compromise
But its alright
Will be alright
Baby you were the love of my life woah
Maybe you dont know whats lost til you find it
Take a walk on Sunday through the afternoon
We can always find somethin for us to do
We dont really like whats on the news but its on all the time
I take you with me every time I go away
In a hotel usin someone elses name
I remember back at Jonnys place its not the same anymore
Its not what I wanted to leave you behind
Dont know where youll land when you fly
But baby you were the love of my life
Its unfortunate ooh
Just coordinates ooh
I dont know you half as well as all my friends
I wont pretend that Ive been doin everything I can
To get to know your creases and your ends
Are they the same
Oohooh
Living in a daydream
She said Love me like you paid me
You know Ill be gone for so long
So give me all of your love give me something to dream about
Stay until the morning
Cause baby loving yous the real thing
It just feels right
When you give me all of your love give me something to dream about
All of your love give me something to dream about
Give me all of your love give me something to dream about
Living in a daydream its all right
Give me all of your love give me something to dream about give me all of your love
Give me all of your love give me something to dream about ooh its all right woo
Give me all of your love give me something to dream about ow

To help you through
If youre feelin down

Ive never been a fan of change
But Id follow you to any place

To get you off my mind get you off my mind
Cant get you off my mind all this late night talkin
I wont even try all this late night talkin
Cant get you off my
All this late night talkin
Holdin me back
Gravitys holdin me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why dont we leave it at that
Nothin to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And Im the one who will stay oh
In this world its just us
You know its not the same as it was
As it was as it was
You know its not the same
Answer the phone
Harry youre no good alone
Why are you sittin at home on the floor
What kind of pills are you on
Ringin the bell
And nobodys comin to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that youre well oh
Go home get ahead lightspeed internet
I dont wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America two kids follow her
I dont wanna talk about whos doin it first
As it was
You got you got the cinema
Its you
And Im not gettin over it
Darlin is it cool
If Im stubborn when it comes to this
I guess were in time
If youre getting yourself wet for me
I guess youre all mine
Youre sleeping in this bed with me
I just think youre cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think Im cool too
Or am I too into you
Tell me what you want and you got it love
I want all of you gimme all you got
Thats cinema
Thats cinema uhhuh
Dont know why but it feels so right to me
Something in the way you move
I like it when you dance for me I just think its
You all the time time time
In doses at night night night
No roof on the drive
Dust off the high
And go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep
I just think youre cool cocool
I dig your cinema cinema
Or am I cinema too into you
Cinema
You got you got
I bring the pop you pop
I bring the pop
I bring the pop to the cinema you pop
I bring the pop to the cinema
You pop when we get intimate
You got you got cinema the cinema
You pop when we get intimate baby youre cinema
You got you got the cinema cinema
You were riding your bike to the sound of Its No Big Deal
And youre trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing about the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming til now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like its no big deal
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family cause they never showed you love
You dont have to be sorry for leaving and growing up mmh
Matilda you talk of the pain like its all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of yous dead inside
You showed me a power that is strong enough to bring sun to the darkest days
Its none of my business but its just been on my mind
You dont have to be sorry for leaving and growing up
You can see the world following the seasons
Anywhere you go you dont need a reason
Cause they never showed you love
You dont have to be sorry for doing it on your own
Youre just in time make your tea and your toast
You framed all your posters and dyed your clothes ooh
You dont have to go
You dont have to go home
Oh theres a long way to go
I dont believe that time will change your mind
In other words
I know they wont hurt you anymore as long as you can let them go
You can start a family who will always show you love
You dont have to be sorry no
Ive been searching nothings working
Ive been tripping no ones perfect
Chasing vision just the surface
Shirts on backwards not on purpose
Ive been learning something bigger
Expectations feet were failing
I found blessings flowing from
The sight of Heaven
Staring into my reflection
Redirecting my perfection somewhere else
Ohh ohh oh
When there isnt any progress
Lean on truth inside the promise it is well
I hold my life out in front of me
Dreams of who I want to be
Im seeing every empty page
I find that everything I am is
Everything I should be
I dont need to run away
Ohh well I dont need to run away
Ohh I dont need to run away
Somethings working heart is turning
Visions clear and still Im learning
That what I am what I am what I am what I am
Is something more than I can plan
Oh ohh
Go tell me now
I been standing on a stage or just a mirror
Forced to face who I become
Searching for a new escape
I scan the exits that embrace an easy out
Need to run away
I dont need to run
Yesterday it finally came a sunny afternoon
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you ooh
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
Theres never been someone whos so perfect for me
But I got over it and I said
Give me somethin old and red
I pay for it more than I did back then
Theres just no gettin through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you
Sittin in the garden Im a couple glasses in
I was tryna count up all the places weve been
Youre always there so dont overthink
Im so over whites and pinks
The grape juice blues
